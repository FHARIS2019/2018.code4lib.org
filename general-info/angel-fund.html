			<h2>Diversity Scholarships Angel Fund</h2>
			<p>
				As part of the Code4Lib community's ongoing commitment to helping under-represented groups excel in
				computing and technology, we offer multiple scholarships to attend the annual conference. In addition
				to <a href="/prospectus/index.html#Diversity-Scholarships">seeking organization sponsors</a>
				for scholarships, we will be able to accept donations from individuals who would like to support the scholarship program on Wednesday, Oct 18th. Individual donors will be thanked on the <a href="/sponsors/">Sponsors</a>
				page, though anonymous donation is also possible.

			</p>
			{% endif %}
			<p>
				All funds raised will help pay for transportation, accommodation, and conference registration costs
				for Code4Lib's Diversity Scholarships recipients for our annual conference. Please feel free to
				direct any question to the <a href="https://wiki.code4lib.org/Code4Lib_2018_Conference_Committees#Scholarship_Committee">Scholarship Committee</a>
				or send message to <a href="mailto:c4l2018-sponsor@umd.edu">c4l2018-sponsor@umd.edu</a>.
