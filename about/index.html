        <h2>Code4Lib is a vibrant and diverse community.</h2>
        <p>
            We are developers and technologists for libraries, museums, and archives who have a strong commitment to open technologies. Code4Lib began as a simple mailing list in 2003 and held its first face-to-face meeting in 2005 in Chicago. The first official annual conference was held in 2006 in Corvallis, Oregon. Code4Lib is dedicated to being a diverse and inclusive community of technologists seeking to share ideas and build collaboration.
