title: "APIs at the Core: How FOLIO Wants to Engage You In Creating New Library Services"
---
<p>
  FOLIO’s design puts the “platform” in “library services platform”.  Everything from initializing the first tenant on the platform to upgrading the circulation business logic module to adding a line in an order is handled with a well-defined RESTful API.  What new service could you create if the details of handling patrons, setting item statuses, and registering/cataloging new content was handled by modules you could extend?  The community of developers and library experts has grown dramatically since Sebastian Hammer first introduced what would be come FOLIO in his 2016 Code4Lib talk “Constructive disintegration -- re-imagining the library platform as microservices”.  Hear how the microservices platform concepts have matured and what it means for services in your library.
