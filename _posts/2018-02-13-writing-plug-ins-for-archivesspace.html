title: 'Writing Plug-ins for ArchivesSpace'

---
Plug-ins provide a simple mechanism to customize ArchivesSpace without changing the core codebase. They can be used to extend or override built-in functionality and the look and feel of the application. Through examples and hands-on activities, this workshop will introduce the concept of plug-ins, demystify the process of building them, and provide participants with tips and tools for building their own.
