<p>
  Web archiving is often undertaken at scale by public and private memory institutions, academic researchers, and the Internet Archive. However, individuals and non-institutional communities also have a stake in documenting particular experiences of the live web: as collectors building our own archives; as subjects represented via captured websites; and as users of web archives that have been constructed in different ways and for a variety of purposes. In this talk, I'll review some ways in which web archives impact a growing code4lib community – as subjects, users, and collectors – and reasons we might have to care about those impacts. I'll also discuss hows and whys of DIY/personal web archiving, which I hope will inspire exploration and action.
