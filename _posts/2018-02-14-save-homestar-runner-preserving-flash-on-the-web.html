title: "Save Homestar Runner!: Preserving Flash on the Web"
---
<p>
  Macromedia (and later, Adobe) Flash was ubiquitous with the web in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as webseries like Homestar Runner can attest. However, the web's evolution has left Flash by the wayside, culminating in Adobe's recent announcement to cease support for Flash by he end of 2020. This presentation explores the issues of web preservation when considering Flash content for the web, as well as strategies for preservation planning.
