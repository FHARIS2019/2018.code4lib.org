title: "Beyond Keywords: Making Search Better"
---
<p>
Text-based retrieval and ranking methods have been with us since the 60s. Open-source projects like Solr and Elastic Search made this technology scalable, performant, and more easily accessible, but what you get out-of-the-box is more or less the same techniques we’ve been talking about for half a century. We can do better! In this talk, we’ll discuss practical techniques for improving your organization’s search engine.
