Working with semi-structured or malformed data requires skills that cross disciplines. Fortunately there are tools that make cleaning and standardizing data easier. This workshop's goals are to introduce participants to OpenRefine, cover basic strategies for
 its use, and perform exercises to familiarize them with its capabilities.
 <p>
 Participants will complete guided exercises where they clean and sort sample data. Participants are expected to have a current <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html\">Java SE Runtime Environment</a> and an installation of the most recent version of <a href=\"http://openrefine.org/download.html\">OpenRefine</a>. The Chrome browser, or its open-source sibling Chromium, are needed for full compatibility with OpenRefine's user interface.
