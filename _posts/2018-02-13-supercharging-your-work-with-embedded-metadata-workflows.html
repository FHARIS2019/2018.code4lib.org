Metadata is the driving force behind digital file management, but not everyone understands how embedded metadata can be, or should be utilized to help with digital file management. Learn how you can use file-naming conventions and specific tools such as Phil Harvey’s EXIFTool or Python scripts to edit, apply, and manage metadata to large batches of files to facilitate asset discovery down the road. We’ll also take a look at how you can read and write embedded metadata to digital files. These embedded metadata exercises can be used to apply to a number of different goals such as:
 <ul>
 <li> Importing/exporting data to and from various systems (For example, integrating PIM/product information management data with a DAM tool)
 <li> Understanding the provenance of digital asset collections for audit
 <li> Automating metadata application using standardized file-naming conventions
 <li> Embedded Metadata Exercises
 <li> View embedded metadata of digital files
 <li> Edit embedded metadata on digital files
 <li> Export embedded metadata from digital files to a CSV or TXT file
 <li> Pair two exported metadata files (CSV) on a single key using Python
 <li> Rename your files using embedded metadata
 <li> Embedded Metadata Exercises in DAM Systems
 <li> Mapping embedded metadata to a taxonomy
 <li> Exporting embedded metadata from a system
 </ul>
 <p>
 And you’ll also learn some tips and tricks for when you might want to use embedded metadata, and other cases where using embedded metadata is not the standard practice (such as on ecommerce websites.)
