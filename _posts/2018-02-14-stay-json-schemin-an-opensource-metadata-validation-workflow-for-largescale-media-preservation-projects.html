title: "Stay JSON Schemin': An open-source metadata validation workflow for large-scale media preservation projects"
---
<p>
  "There are a number of resources such as PBCore and AE-57 for defining metadata specifications for a digitization project, but there are very few resources on how to ensure that the metadata you receive meets your specifications. This presentation outlines an approach taken using JSON Schema to validate the metadata produced by in-house and external labs across multiple projects while digitizing a quarter-million audio, video, and film media.

After discussing our initial use of spreadsheets, the problems they solved, and the problems they caused, we will introduce our metadata schema and demonstrate how we use it for validation. Particularly important, we will discuss how we maintain and update the schema over time, and how its use has strengthened our preservation workflows.
