This hands-on workshop details the steps involved in successfully integrating Alma, Summon and OS discovery systems including Blacklight and VUFind. This will be a technical workshop--a deep dive with a review of the Alma and Summon APIs used in production today, an emphasis on obstacles faced during development, best practice documentation, and ongoing maintenance. Most importantly, the technical details of the integrations will be accompanied by the strategic decisions faced by libraries during the project. Come learn more about existing open source projects and how to develop within the open Ex Libris framework.
