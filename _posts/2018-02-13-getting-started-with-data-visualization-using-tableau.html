<a href="https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/">Tableau Public</a> is a data visualization tool that allows you to explore
information quickly and intuitively to find new insights. This half-day workshop will review best practices for data
visualization and introduce participants to building interactive data visualizations on Tableau. Participants will learn
how to load and prepare data in Tableau, build interactive dashboards with multiple visualizations that can be filtered
and interact with one another, and publish visualizations on the web.
