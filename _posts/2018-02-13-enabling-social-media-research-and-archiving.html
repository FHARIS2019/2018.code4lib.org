Social media data represents a tremendous opportunity for memory institutions
of all kinds, be they large academic research libraries, or small community
archives. Researchers from a broad swath of disciplines have a great deal of
interest in working with social media content, but they often lack access to
datasets or the technical skills needed to create them. Further, it is clear
that social media is already a crucial part of the historical record in areas
ranging from events your local community to national elections. But attempts to
build archives of social media data are largely nascent. This workshop will be
both an introduction to collecting data from the APIs of social media platforms,
as well as a discussion of the roles of libraries and archives in that
collecting.
<br>
<br>
Assuming no prior experience, the workshop will begin with an explanation of
how APIs operate. We will then focus specifically on the Twitter API, as Twitter
is of significant interest to researchers and hosts an important segment of
discourse. Through a combination of hands-on and demos, we will gain experience
with a number of tools that support collecting social media data (e.g., Twarc,
Social Feed Manager, DocNow, Twurl, and TAGS), as well as tools that enable
sharing social media datasets (e.g., Hydrator, TweetSets, and the Tweet ID
Catalog).  The workshop will then turn to a discussion of how to build a
successful program enabling social media collecting at your institution. This
might cover a variety of topics including outreach to campus researchers,
collection development strategies, the relationship between social media
archiving and web archiving, and how to get involved with the social media
archiving community. This discussion will be framed by a focus on ethical
considerations of social media data, including privacy and responsible data
sharing.
<br>
<br>
Time permitting, we will provide a sampling of some approaches to social
media data analysis, including Twarc Utils and Jupyter Notebooks.
