title: Low-Cost Preservation Environment Monitoring with the Raspberry Pi
---
<p>
Controlling environmental conditions is an important tool used in preserving archives and manuscripts; in combination with HVAC systems, independent datalogger devices collect measurements such as temperature and relative humidity. This talk will detail the presenterâ€™s construction of a do-it-yourself datalogger using the Raspberry Pi and compare its performance against a popular, but expensive, commercial device.
